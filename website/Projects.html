							<p>Cloud Resume Challenge<br>
							This challenge was about creating a website about myself and uploading it, deploying it, and creating various functions to make this fully functional web page from within AWS. a link to the challenge is below:<br>
                            <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a></p>
							<p>Database Virtualization <br>
                                This project was one that I did for a project at Western Governors University. For this project, I had to create 2 IIS servers, a domain controller, and 2 database vms. This was to simulate a gaming environment that was hosting the game through the internet.<br>
                                I created 3 port groups on one vswitch and created an address scheme for each of the 3 VLANs. After creating the Domain Controller, I joined all the virtual machines to the domain, added IIS to my web servers, added DHCP to my domain controller, and enabled DNS.<br>
                                After all this, I opened port 3389 to all the instances so that I would be able to utilize RDP using a jumper computer to remote in. I verified that DNS was working on each instance and created the DHCP scope on my Domain Controller.<br>
                                I used ping from each instance to verify that I was able to send and receive data packets to each instance. This meant that the computers were finally talking to each other!<br>
                                Next was time to configure the load balancer. After all was set and done, the project was complete! This project was hard since there was little resources to go off of so I had to think outside the box on it. It made it fun and challenging and I would definetely do it again!

                            <p>Automation<br>
                                This project involved creating a script that would automatically take an excel sheet (csv) and turning all that information that had user information to create user account from within active directory.<br>
                                I used powershell for the script and it was very fascinating since this was my first dive into using powershell.
                            </p>
                            <p>Auto Deploy<br>
                                This project involved auto deploying servers and then turning them off after x sessions were in progress.<br>
                                With pay as you go model pricing for the cloud, this is extremely useful since it can help maintain costs and keep efficiency in check.<br>
                                The resources that I used for this project was AWS, Chef Puppet, Powershell, and VMWare.</p>
